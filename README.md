# DataMiningCourse_EduProject
Data Mining Course, Hebrew University, spring 2020 - our final project about the education system in Israel.

in this repository you'll find the final project of Maayan Sharon and Imri Dror.
In this project we analyzed the education system in Israel and came up with some meaningful insights.

writeup.pdf - a paper contains the summary of our work, methods, conclusions, products etc.
code - a file with some of the scripts we wrote, excel sheets, copies of main diagrams and other products we thought are interesting to explore.

we also included some of the files we produced along the way but did not serve us in our final paper.
